Graph G=(V,E) is defined by a set of vertices V, a set of edges E consisting of ordered or unordered pairs of vertices from V.

Data structure:
1. Adjacency matrix
2. Adjacency Lists

Adjacency list to incidence matrix: O(N+M)+O(MN)=O(MN)
Incidence matrix to adjacency list: O(M)+O(N)+O(MN)=O(MN)

Traversing a graph => marking vertices
* The key idea is that we must mark each vertex when we first visit it, and keep track of what we have not yet completely explored.
* 3 states: undiscovered => discovered => processed
* Data structure:
  - bool processed\[MAXV\]
  - bool discovered\[MAXV\]
  - int parents\[MAXV\] (discoverer)

```cpp
// breadth search first O(M+N)
void BSF(graph *g, int start){
  queue q;
  int v, y;
  edgenode *p;
  init_queue(&q);
  enqueue(&q, start);
  discovered[start] = TRUE;
  while(empty_queue(&q) == FALSE){
    v = dequeue(&q);
    process_vertex_early(v);  //make purpose at process_* function
    processed[v] = TRUE;
    p = g->edges[v];
    while(p!=NULL){
      y = p->y;
      if(processed[y] == FALSE || g->directed) process_edge(v, y);
      if(discovered[y] == FALSE){
        discovered[y] = TRUE;
        enqueue(&q, y);
        parents[y] = v;
      }
      p = p->next;
    }
    process_vertex_late(v);
  }
}
```

* parents maintained a BFS tree with graph g
* BFS with smallest number go edges, parents maintained a shortest path

```cpp
// find connected components
void connected_components(graph *g){
  int c,i;
  ini_search(g);
  c = 0;
  for(i=1; i<=g->nvertices;i++){
    if(discovered[i]==FALSE){
      c += 1;
      BFS(g, i);
    }
  }
}
```

* DFS has neat recursive implementation which eliminates the need to explicitly use a stack
* In undirected graph, every edge is either a tree edge or a back edge

```cpp
DFS(graph *g, int v){
  edgenode *p;
  int y;
  if(finished) return;
  discovered[v] = TRUE;
  time += 1;
  entry.time[v] = time;
  process_vertex_early[v];
  p = g->edges[v];
  whie(p != NULL){
    y = p->y;
    if(discovered[y] == FALSE){
       parents[y] = v;
       process_edge(x, y);
       dfs(g, y);
    }
    else if((!processed[y]) || (g->directed)) process_edge(x, y);
    if(finished) return;
    p = p->next;
  }
  process_vertex_late;
  time += 1;
  exit.time[v] = time;
  processed[v] = TRUE;
}
```

```cpp
// finding cycles
// i think it's parents[y] != x
// y must be find by x, x is y's parent
void process_edge(int x, int y){
  if(parents[x] != y){
    find.path(y, x, parent);
    finished = TRUE;
  }
}
```

* Bipartite: a graph can be colored without conflicts while using only two colors. (Tree)

* Articulation vertex: a vertex of a connected grapg whose deletion disconnects the graph.(can be found in O(n(m+n)) delete each vertex to do a DFS on remaining graph)
  - faster O(n+m) DFS algorithm: if v is not a leaf and some subtree of v has no back edge incident until a proper ancestor of v.


* Topological sorting: an ordering on the vertices so that all edges go from left to right.
  - Identifying errors in DNA fragment assembly
  - **find all in-degree 0 vertices and do DFS, deal with all the edgenodes out from those vertices**

```cpp
// check if a graph is a DAG
process_edge(int x, int y){
  int class;
  class = edge.classification(x, y);
  if (class == BACK) printf("not a DAG\n");
}
```

* DAG: A directed, acyclic graph has no directed cycles.(scheduling jobs)
  - DAGS has at least one topological sort.


* Weighted graph Algorithms: an alternate universe of algorithms for edge-weighted graphs.
  - Spanning Tree: a subgraph of G which has the same set of vertices of G and is a tree.
  - Mininum spanning tree can be generate by greedy algorithms
  - Prim's Algorithm: **starts from one vertex and grows the rest of the tree an edge at a time, pick a minimum weight edge without creating a cycle**
  - Kruskal's Algorithm:

```cpp
typedef struct {
  int y;
  int weight;
  struct edgenode *next;
} edgenode;
```

```cpp
/*
Prim-MST(G):
  select an arbitrary vertex s to start the tree from.
  While (there still non-tree vertices)
    pick a minumun edge without creating a cycle, add the connected vertices into tree
  can be done in O(nm) time by doing a DFS or BFS to loop through all edges.
*/
prim(graph *g, int start){
  int i; // counter
  edgenode *p; // temp pointer
  bool intree[MAXV]; // is vertex in the tree
  int distance[MAXV]; // distance from start
  int v; // current vertex
  int w; // candidate next vertex
  int weight; // edge weight
  int dist; // best current distance from start
  // init
  for(i=1;i<=g->nvertices;i++){
    intree[i] = FALSE;
    distance[i] = MAXINT;
    parent[i] = -1
  }
  distance[start] = 0;
  v = start;
  while(intree[v] == FALSE){
    intree[v] = TRUE;
    p = g->edges[v];
    while(p != NULL){
      w = p->y;
      weight = p->weight;
      if((distance[w]>weight) && (intree[w] == FALSE)){
        distance[w] = weight;
        parent[w] = v;
      }
      p = p->next;
    }
    v = 1;
    dist = MAXINT;
    for(i=1; i<=g->nvertices; i++){
      if((intree[i] == FALSE) && (dist > distance[i])){
        dist = distance[i];
        v = i;
      }
    }
  }

}
```
